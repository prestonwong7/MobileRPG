# MobileRPG
> Mobile RPG is a game created by five developers using Unity 2D that can be used on Android, iOS, and PC. It uses ground sprites called Roguelike/RPG pack created by Kenney. We followed a tutorial on Youtube called GamesPlusJames, which allowed us to make a realistic 2D RPG game. However, making it compatible on the iOS and Android was completely our task. In Mobile RPG, you are a prince who will be going through an intense plot of saving your dad from evil slimes! Grow stronger as you level up, gaining more hp, attack damage, and more!
